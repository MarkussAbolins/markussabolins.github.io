<div class="christmasGreeting">
    Ha! Rhyming and all that jazzâ€”pretty funny, right? No, scratch that, Iâ€™m absolutely hilarious. Seriously, you should
    come see me at an open mic one day.
    Itâ€™s going to happen. Eventually.
    At some point. And when it does, Iâ€™ll be up there, pouring my soul into a mic, trying to make strangers laugh while
    secretly hoping my friends are in the audience, cheering me on. <br>
    (By reading this, you are now legally (please, don't consult a lawyer) bound to laugh hysterically at all my jokes
    (all of them ever). Failure to comply may result in severe side effects, such as an uncontrollable urge to re-read
    my jokes until you finally get how brilliant they are.) <br> <br>
    So, first of all - <div class="christmas">Merry Christmas!</div>
    <br>
    I hope my gift, whatever it ended up as, made it safely to you! Well I suppose if you're reading this it did

<div class="letterBody">
    So, first of all (yes, Iâ€™m starting like this again)â€”Hi! I hope youâ€™re spending your Christmas surrounded by
    friends, loved ones, and a mountain of festive treats. Merry Christmas once more! ðŸŽ„
    Iâ€™ll admit, I donâ€™t know you as well as Iâ€™d like to, but from everything Iâ€™ve seen and heard, you strike me as
    someone truly special. Youâ€™re warm, fun, and refreshingly genuineâ€”a rare mix these days.
    Honestly, I think you complement Alex beautifully. You both just work together, and itâ€™s so clear to anyone who sees
    you interact.
    I do have to apologize if this letter feels shorter than what others might get. (Not that they should be sharing
    their letters anywayâ€”privacy is a thing, people! ðŸ˜ ).<br>
    But please, donâ€™t take that as any reflection on you. Itâ€™s not about length; itâ€™s about sincerity, and every word
    here is meant from the heart.
    You seem to be a wonderful, kind, and passionate person, and I truly hope you continue to be that person. Life has a
    way of throwing all kinds of nonsense our wayâ€”especially in jobs, where managers love to sprinkle on the extra
    stress.
    But no matter how much bullshit they try to push on you, keep your chin high. Youâ€™re stronger than you (might)
    realize, and youâ€™re in such a great position in life. Never lose sight of that.
    Youâ€™re incredibly smart and capable, and donâ€™t you dare let anyone convince you otherwise. Surround yourself with
    people who see that brilliance in you because you deserve nothing less.
    Itâ€™s been such a joy hanging out with you in LapmeÅ¾ciems. Those moments have been filled with laughter and good
    vibes, and Iâ€™d love for you to join Alex and me more often when weâ€™re hanging out at Gauja.
    Honestly, the more, the merrierâ€”your energy is infectious, and itâ€™s always a good time when youâ€™re around.
    I know this letter isnâ€™t as long as some others might be, and I truly hope that doesnâ€™t come across the wrong way.
    Youâ€™re a fantastic person, and I mean no offense if this feels a bit short.
    This isnâ€™t about quantity; <br><br><br><br><br>
    But waitâ€”donâ€™t leave yet!<br><br><br><br>
    Why are you still reading?<br><br><br><br>
    Oh, right!<br><br><br><br>
    More cool stuff is on the way!<br><br><br>
    Whatâ€™s this?<br><br><br><br>
    A playlist of music below???<br><br><br><br>
    I would never.<br><br><br><br>
    â€¦Okay, fine, I totally would. And I did biiiiiiiiiiiitch.<br><br><br><br>
    Hereâ€™s some music that I hope youâ€™ll enjoyâ€”a collection of songs that I think you might connect with or at least
    find interesting. Maybe youâ€™ll find a new favorite track in there. Either way, I hope it brings a smile to your
    face.
    Music! Cool, awesome music, just for you. Enjoy! ðŸŽ¶

    Iâ€™m not sure if you use Tidal like Alex does, but I wanted to make sure you can still enjoy this music as easily as
    possible.
    So, Iâ€™ve taken the time to include embeds and links for some of the most popular streaming services. Whether youâ€™re
    a Spotify loyalist, an Apple Music fan, or use something else entirely, Iâ€™ve got you covered.
    I wanted to make this as seamless as possible because I truly hope youâ€™ll take the time to listen.
