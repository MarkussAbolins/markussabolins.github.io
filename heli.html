    I hope my gift, whatever it ended up as, made it safely to you! Well I suppose if you're reading this it did

    Pfft, that warning above? Just ignore it! Who even wrote that nonsense? What an absolute clown. Warnings are for
    pussies anyway. And guess what?
    It seems I’ll be rambling a bit more in this letter than in the others. So what? Who’s going to stop me?
    Absolutely no one. Not you, not anyone. This is my moment, and I’ll write as much as I damn well please. So buckle
    up, because this is going to be a wild, slightly chaotic ride.
    You’ve been warned—wait, scratch that, we don’t do warnings here.
    Except for the ones that have already been done. Does that even make sense? Should it? Do I care? Absolutely not.
    Lmao.
    How’s that for a start to a heartfelt letter? A fucking masterpiece, if you ask me. Honestly, no one writes intros
    to letters like I do.
    I’m the GOAT of letter-writing!<br>
    So, back on topic—I want to thank you once again for showing me around Helsinki and your hometown, Klaukkala.
    (At least, I think that was it? Finnish town names are a major pain in the ass to remember. Seriously, they suck.)
    Your kindness made my trip to Funland (haha) an absolute joy. It turned out so much better than I ever could have
    imagined. Honestly, in a million years,
    I don’t think I’d have ended up in an overpriced club in what I assume was the heart of Helsinki. (Was it the heart?
    Who knows?
    I had no clue where I was half the time. I really need to stop blindly going places just because someone tells me
    to.)
    Or that overpriced (but lovely) bar where the cocktails were offensively small.
    Speaking of that night — pretty sure I completed the dare. One could argue that my chaotic movements in the club
    might loosely qualify as public breakdancing.
    And, once again, let me just say — your punishments? Absolute garbage. Shots with you? Bitch, please. That’s not a
    punishment;
    And telling people random facts about Latvia? I live for that. I’d do it all day, every day, if it weren’t for the
    looming threat of someone calling the police for harassment.
    Speaking of police, I still have no idea what they wanted with me that one time. Turns out, saying "okei" and giving
    them a thumbs-up is a surprisingly effective way to make them go away. Who knew?
    Drinking overpriced Latvian beer under the cover of rain? Priceless. Well, not priceless. Actually expensive.
    Speaking of which, I’m really glad to hear you enjoyed the ones I got you. Are Latvian beers the absolute pinnacle
    of beers? Of course they are. And no, I’m not biased at all—just stating undeniable facts.
    And then there was the sauna — so lovely!
    Throwing myself into absolutely freezing water afterward? Less lovely, but memorable. Okay, fine, I exaggerated a
    bit about the throwing myself and the water temperature. Don't care — next question.
    My only disappointment? You didn’t follow my lead and dive into the water yourself. Have you even done that before?
    You should. Seriously, do it, pussy!
    Now, about that pizza and beer place with no beer. That will haunt me for the rest of my days. I’m
    blaming you entirely for that. How can a place with a giant fucking sticker that says “Pizza & Beer” only deliver
    on 50% of the promise? Sure, they had sour beers, and while I guess they technically qualify as beers, I’m not
    entirely convinced. At least the pizza was damn good, so there’s that.
    As for Poorvo? Your recommendation? Total garbage. I lied when I said I liked it. I hated it. The weather was
    miserable, and there were far too many tourists. Was I part of the problem? Of course not. It was definitely all the
    other tourists at fault.

    Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the Christmas caroling in what you called the "ugliest church in Finland." Sure, all
    the songs seemed to be about death and despair—but honestly, did I know that or care at the time? Not at all. To me,
    they sounded cheerful enough. Maybe it’s just a Finnish thing, but I think you all have a tone problem.
    Thank you for multiple times providing context during the songs. Full disclosure, I was completely lost for most of
    it.
    <br>
    But all jokes aside, above everything else, I want to thank you for taking so much time to spend with me. I’m not
    sure if I’ve properly thanked you for that yet, so here it is: thank you. You were such a joy to hang out with, and
    I really appreciated the effort you put into making my time in Finland special.
    Thank you also for introducing me to some wonderful people. I’ve met so many fantastic individuals thanks to you,
    and those memories mean a lot to me. Is this too many “thank you’s”? Maybe. Do I care? Not at all. My letter, my
    rules. Your opinion? Irrelevant. You’re a woman, duh.
    Besides, Christmas is the time for being thankful or something, right?
    <br>
    Okay, back on topic once again.

    Heli, I can’t say that I know you well—I’ve only had the chance to meet you a handful of times. But even from those
    brief encounters, one thing is abundantly clear: you’re an incredibly intelligent person. Honestly, the topics you
    bring up sometimes leave me at a loss for words. Not gonna lie, I often find myself thinking, “Wow, I have no idea
    what to say here. Am I just dumb?” Maybe if we meet again, you can speak to me in simpler terms? You know, dumb it
    down a little for my sake?

    What I’m really trying to say is this: it’s obvious that you’ve put so much effort into becoming the person you are.
    And that’s something to be incredibly proud of. Don’t ever throw that away. Keep being the driven, brilliant person
    you are, and go kick some serious ass in Oulu! (Side note: what’s up with that name? Oulu? Egg? I’ll never
    understand Finnish city names.)

    You strike me as a wonderful person, and that’s something you should never change. Go out there and chase your
    dreams. Get rich, buy a yacht, and hell, do some designer cocaine on that thing if that’s your vibe.
    Achieve your (weird, unhealthy) dreams!
    You’ve earned
    the world—don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

    Perhaps we’ll meet again someday. Or maybe we won’t.
    <br><br><br><br>
    Maybe in another life.
    <br><br><br><br>

    Ohhh, you thought that was it? Nope. There’s more. Obviously.

    Now, I’ll admit—I don’t know you that well, so I have no idea what kind of music you’re really into. Other than
    Finnish songs about death, apparently. But here’s a playlist I put together for you! It’s mostly songs I noticed you
    recognized while we were driving around, so some of it might feel familiar. Still, I’m hoping you’ll find a few
    surprises in there too — something new.

    Now, as for how to actually listen to it? Well, I have no idea what streaming service you use. So, being the
    thoughtful genius I am, I’ve included multiple options. If none of these work for you, maybe take a moment to
    reflect on your life choices. Seriously, what are you even doing?
