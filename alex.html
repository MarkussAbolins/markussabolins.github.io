    So, first of all - <div class="christmas">Merry Christmas!</div>

    I truly hope my gift—whatever form it ultimately took—made it safely to you.
     I spent a lot of time and thought putting this together, wanting it to feel special and meaningful.
      If you’re reading this, then I guess it arrived safely, and I can only hope it brings even a fraction of the joy* I felt while creating it for you.<br><br>
      *Honestly, there was a lot of frustration too. Do you even realize how much effort all this shit took?
       There were moments I wanted to throw my hands up and scream (I did many times), wondering why I was even doing this in the first place.
        Maybe I’m completely insane for going to such lengths, but deep down, I kept going because I truly, desperately hope it will mean something.
         That it’ll be worth it. That you’ll feel even a glimpse of what I put into this.

    I know, technically, the first time I met you was at Beera. But, on some level,
     I think the night you—completely out of the blue (at least to me)—invited me to go aurora watching was when I really met you for the first time. Sure, the aurora itself was barely visible to the naked eye,
      but that’s not what I remember from that night. What I remember is the chance you took on me, inviting me out so spontaneously. That night wasn’t about the aurora; it was about the people. It was about you.
    You gave me a gift that night—one I didn’t fully understand at the time. I met some truly amazing people, including you, and I want to thank you for that. Over this past year, I’ve changed so much.
     Honestly, I’m surprised the old me even agreed to go out that night. The old me was cautious, hesitant, probably on the verge of saying, “Sorry, I’m busy.” A big part of me was afraid—afraid of making new friends,
      of risking the heartache that comes with loss. For so long, that fear shaped my life.
    But you’ve been a big part of changing that. You’ve shown me that taking a leap of faith—meeting new people, enjoying their presence instead of fearing their absence—is worth it.
     I don’t know if I can attribute it all to you, but since meeting you, I feel like I’ve become a better person.
    You’ve introduced me to so many wonderful people from all walks of life, people I never would have met otherwise. Every pint we’ve shared (and there have been many—so many 😄),
     every karaoke song we’ve belted out together, every visit to Lapmežciems—all of it has meant the world to me. All of the advice you've given me.
    Even the times we’ve stood outside, puffing away at our questionable life choices. (Okay, seriously, we should quit at some point. I’m fine; I’m young as hell.
     But you’re getting old. You really should quit. So should I, I guesssss. Maybe one day. Nicotine really is a bop, though.)
    I know this might sound cliché—maybe all of this is just one big cliché—but you’ve been a huge inspiration to me. Your constant drive, your business ideas,
     your determination to keep going and strive for something greater—it’s left such a positive impression on me. There’s no doubt about it: I’ve become a better man since I met you. And for that, I can’t thank you enough.
    So here’s to many more fun get-togethers. (Imagine me raising a beer here. Cheers!)<br><br><br><br><br>
    This is the end.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    Of the letter, that is.<br><br><br>
    Wait… did that sound like a suicide letter?<br>
    Bitch, please. I’m going to outlive you by so much, I’ll set records for being the oldest person on earth. I’ll win a triathlon while smoking a cigarette every kilometer.<br>
    Or, alternatively, I’ll get famous and overdose at 27 while winning an Oscar post-death. Who knows? Life’s a trip.<br>

    AND THAT'S NOT ALL!
    <br><br>
    I’ve put together a playlist of songs that I truly hope you will enjoy. Each track was chosen with care, and I feel
    they reflect moments and emotions I wanted to share with you.
    <br><br>
    Now, here’s the challenge: you better listen carefully, because the next time we sing karaoke, we’re taking on these
    songs back to back to back! No excuses, no skipping! Just kidding (well, mostly). But honestly, I created this
    playlist not just for karaoke fun but as a way to share something meaningful with you.
    <br><br>
    Some of these songs hold a special place in my heart, and I hope they resonate with you too. You’ll find tracks from
    "Biting Elbows," a band that’s become one of my favorites lately. They’re Russian, and if that name sounds familiar,
    it might be because their music was featured in Death Stranding. Perhaps you’ll recognize a few!
    <br><br>
    The playlist below is embedded through Tidal, but if the embed doesn’t work, don’t worry—I’ve included a link as
    well. I really hope these songs bring a smile to your face or give you a moment of joy. Music has a way of
    connecting us, and this is my way of saying, “Hey, here’s something I care about. Let’s share this together.”
